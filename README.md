Golf and Disc golf web application. (score keeping, maps, schedules, events)

## Getting Started

Go to the Projects link above > then go to the Pseucode project. From there you'll be able to see open issues ( we can treat them like tickets or 'to-do'. Also, go to the Issues link above to create new goals or ideas.

Please view the flowcharts in the WGDiagram folder (you'll need a copy of Visio for the editable version), or just look at the snippet pictures in the same folder or below.

Naming Conventions: 

  lowerCamelCase = (i.e. "numHole" + "realShotType" + "displayCurrentHole")

Java Coding Style:

```
//COMMENTS
function displayCurrentHole() {
    document.getElementById("currentHole").innerHTML = numHole;
}

//COMMENTS
function getElementByID(element) {
    document.getElementById(element);
}

//New hole counter function
function newHole() {
    projectedShots();
    actualShotsFunction();
    numHole +=1; 
    if (numHole >= 19) {
        alert(projected);
        alert(actualShots);
    }   
    displayCurrentHole();  
}
```

### Goals
